The SCO EdgeWise add-on for Blender is a precision measurement tool designed for use in Edit Mode. It allows users to measure distances, edge lengths, and angles directly in the 3D View, leveraging the active unit system (Metric or Imperial). The add-on includes features to measure distances between vertices, lengths of edges or contiguous edge groups, and angles between edges. Additionally, it provides a unique functionality to calculate distances along specific axes (X, Y, Z) relative to the 3D Cursor, displaying results clearly in the UI. This tool is ideal for modeling tasks requiring accurate dimensional feedback.
